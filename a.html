        <td><i>Something</i> goes horrifically wrong during a rough and rowdy night of band practice, resulting in the brutal death of beloved friend Richard Long.

A24 put it best when they wrote, "Daniel Scheinert 'expertly balances the hilarity and heartache of what happens when dark secrets are dragged kicking and screaming into the light.'"</td>
