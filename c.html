          You put it in a pan, you cook it. You want seasoning? You season it. I have a saying in my home: "The food speaks for itself!" If I had to put that in a different way: this steak will be delicious anyway. A Salad without dressing, delicious. Eggs that have never seen so much as a grain of salt... amazing.
