        <td>Look at the map, have you noticed how many state parks, national parks, national forests and all around amazing things are there? When I was a young boy, my grandfather took us (that being my brother and I) on a trip to Yellowstone. I almost cry every single time I think about these trips because they put something there for me. Wanderlust is one thing, but I don't want to give it an aimless approach. I some day want to hit the entirety of the NPS. Papa did the contiguous 48, and I will never forget the way he spoke about California. I'm sure if he had the trip in him, he would've taken us, but even Wyoming is a long haul, so I understand why he couldn't do a roadtrip out to Cali.</td>
